# Alexa Auto SDK

Alexa Auto SDK contains essential client-side software required to integrate Alexa into the automobile. The Alexa Auto SDK provides a runtime engine for communicating with the Alexa service. It also provides interfaces that allow the developer to implement platform specific behavior such as audio input, media playback, template and state rendering, and phone control. It also includes two sample applications that demonstrates how to use the Alexa Auto SDK interfaces.

## Alexa Auto SDK Architecture<a id="architecture"></a> Overview

The Alexa Auto SDK is designed to allow flexibility in the integration of Alexa as a part of the automotive in-cabin experience. The Alexa Auto SDK Engine provides runtime support for Alexa and other services and allows the application to integrate with platform specific functionality. Platform specific behavior in Alexa Auto is abstracted into interfaces called "Platform Interfaces." These interfaces should be extended in the application and registered with the Engine.

The Platform Interfaces are documented in their respective module's API documentation.

> **Note**: This diagram shows only some of the available platform interfaces.

![architecture](./assets/aac_architecture.png)

### ![Alexa Auto SDK Engine](./assets/number-1.png) Alexa Auto SDK Engine

The runtime implementation of the Alexa Auto SDK is known as the Engine. Modules extend the Engine by providing services and defining the runtime behavior for Platform Interfaces that are registered by the application. The application software communicates with the Engine through the API defined by the Platform Interfaces.

### ![Alexa Auto SDK Engine](./assets/number-2.png) Core Module

The Core Module includes Platform Interfaces and runtime Engine support for Core features in the Alexa Auto SDK, such as logging, location, and network information. The services are used by components in other modules and are required by Alexa Auto SDK.

Click [here](./modules/core/README.md) for more information.

### ![Alexa Auto SDK Engine](./assets/number-3.png) Alexa Module

The Alexa Module includes Platform Interfaces and runtime Engine support for Alexa features in the Alexa Auto SDK. View some [sequence diagrams](./SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.md) for more details.

This module includes support for audio input, media playback, template and state rendering, and much more.

### ![Alexa Auto SDK Engine](./assets/number-4.png) Navigation Module

The Navigation Module includes Platform Interfaces and runtime Engine support for Alexa to interface with the onboard navigation system.

Click [here](./modules/navigation/README.md) for more information.

### ![Alexa Auto SDK Engine](./assets/number-5.png) Phone Control Module

The Phone Control Module includes Platform Interfaces and runtime Engine support for Alexa to interface with the onboard telephony system.

## Additional Functionality
The following extensions to the Alexa Auto SDK are available by request. Please contact your Amazon Solutions Architect (SA) or Partner Manager for more information.

### Wake Word Extension
Wake Word enables hands-free, voice-initiated interactions with Alexa. The Wake Word extension enables AmazonLite Wake Word support in the Alexa Auto SDK.

### Alexa Communication Extension
The Alexa Communication extension enables integration with Alexa-to-Alexa calling, Alexa-to-PSTN calling, and messaging capabilities.

### Local Voice Control Extension
The Local Voice Control extension provides car control functionality like climate control with and without an internet connection. It includes components that run an Alexa endpoint inside the vehicle's head unit. Local Voice Control is currently supported on Linux x86 64-bit, Linux ARM 32/64-bit, Android x86 32/64-bit, and Android ARM 32/64-bit.

### Metrics Uploading Extension
The Metrics Uploading extension enables logging and uploading Alexa Auto SDK metrics to the Amazon cloud. Voice request metrics, for example, include start and end timestamps of user and Alexa speech and UPL between the request and Alexaâ€™s response. Metrics may be tagged Beta, Gamma, or Prod depending on the vehicle lifecycle. The Metrics Uploading extension is currently available for Android platforms.
