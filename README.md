# alexa-auto

**Prerequisites:** Alexa Auto Android Sample App is already implemented and running per the official instructions:  https://github.com/alexa/aac-sdk



## aac-sdk 1.6

The subfolders located under **aac-sdk 1.6** include a quick reference to implement the following features on top of Alexa Auto SDK 1.6 (Andoid Implementation):


1. **Local Media Implementation:** Quick guide to register a local media device (a USB in this case).

2. **Routing Implementation:** Quick guide to start and cancel routing, using a custom skill that searches for ice-cream shops using a Yelp API and sends the ‘best option’ to the Auto SDK that invokes Google Maps.

3. **MQTT Implementation:** Quick guide to implement MQTT messaging between the Android Sample App and AWS IoT.

In each folder, a README presents a detailed notes on the specific implementation and the aac-sdk folder has the implementation. For the routing example, the sample skill is placed in a separate folder (ice-cream-finder).
The implementation in the aac-sdk folder is based on AUTO SDK 1.6, with only the changes required to implement the described tasks.
