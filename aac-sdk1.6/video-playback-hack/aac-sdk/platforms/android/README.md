# Alexa Auto SDK for Android

## Introduction

For the Android platform, the Alexa Auto SDK is wrapped by a JNI layer which mirrors the native C++ API. This layer is built into the `aace` Android library project. You can view it by opening `${AAC_SDK_HOME}/platforms/android` in Android Studio.

This document refers to the Java API classes.
